This project is a menu page for a fictional cafÃ© named "Cafilla".
The entire design is created by me using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on simplicity and clean layout.
The cafÃ© is not real â€” this project is meant to showcase my skills in front-end web design.

ðŸ’¡ Note: The project is still in progress and currently under development.
